       	What do you think about my website ATM ?                               
       	Is that ugly for you ? .txt                              
     	What you are looking at is a regular .txt file.      
       	There is no style on them, and that is why .txt
	files are so beautiful.  Recently I developed a 
	healthy obsession with text files. Since this day
	I am trying now the spray the <3 of .txt.
	Come to my tribe
